# Developer Guide
Developers who are interested in running our project locally must have Next.js and PostgreSQL installed. Our tech stack also uses ESLint, Typescript, Bootstrap 5, and React, with deployment via Vercel.

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Change into the root directory for the project (store-dash) using `cd` command. Then install the necessary third party libraries using `npm install`.
3. Configure PostgreSQL Database by installing PostgreSQL on your local machine.
Then set up your .env.local file in the root of the project with the PostgreSQL connection string: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname` and run database migrations with `npx prisma migrate reset`
4. Run the Project Locally with `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the running local application.

# Development History
## Milestone 1
Milestone 1 aimed to establish a basic outline of our appâ€™s design. Our primary focus was on creating the visual structure and layout to resemble a functional app, without yet implementing full functionality. By setting up the foundational framework, we can efficiently add and refine features in future milestones.

Milestone 1 was managed using [Store Dash GitHub Project Board Milestone 1](https://github.com/orgs/tiny-team/projects/1/views/1):
