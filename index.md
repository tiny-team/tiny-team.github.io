# Overview
Many households struggle to keep track of food items spread across pantries, refrigerators, freezers, and spice racks. With multiple storage spaces and no clear system, it becomes difficult to know what’s in stock, where items are located, or when something is running low or about to expire. This disorganization often leads to wasted food, duplicate purchases, and missed opportunities to plan meals efficiently.

PantryWise is a user-friendly web application designed to solve this issue. It provides an easy way to organize and track items across all storage locations, no matter how many pantries or fridges a household has. Users can add, remove, and update items, set refill levels, and generate shopping lists when supplies run low. The app can also be extended with features like recipe suggestions, expiration date tracking, and barcode scanning to make managing food storage even more seamless. By keeping everything in one place, the app helps users reduce waste, save money, and simplify everyday meal planning.

# Developer Guide
Developers who are interested in running our project locally must have Next.js and PostgreSQL installed. Our tech stack also uses ESLint, Typescript, Bootstrap 5, and React.

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Change into the root directory for the project (pantry-wise) using `cd` command. Then install the necessary third party libraries using `npm install`.
3. Configure PostgreSQL Database by installing PostgreSQL on your local machine.
Then set up your .env.local file in the root of the project with the PostgreSQL connection string: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname` and run database migrations with `npx prisma migrate reset`
4. Run the Project Locally with `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the running local application.

# Development History
## Milestone 1
Milestone 1 aimed to establish a basic outline of our app’s design. Our primary focus was on creating the visual structure and layout to resemble a functional app, without yet implementing full functionality. By setting up the foundational framework, we can efficiently add and refine features in future milestones.

Milestone 1 was managed using [PantryWise GitHub Project Board Milestone 1](https://github.com/orgs/tiny-team/projects/1/views/1)
